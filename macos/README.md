# SpaceSaver — macOS

Native macOS packaging of the web space-screensaver, rendered across **all
displays as one continuous world**. The virtual canvas is the bounding box of
every `NSScreen`; each display renders its slice via the web page's
`?view=x,y,W,H` frustum split, and one display drives the simulation while the
rest follow over `?sync=master|follow` (`BroadcastChannel`). All of this is
derived generically from the live display arrangement — nothing is hard-coded.

There are **two targets** in `SpaceSaver.xcodeproj`:

| Target | Product | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`SpaceSaverApp`** | `SpaceSaver.app` | ✅ **Use this.** Works fully — seamless, synced, WebGL across all displays. |
| `SpaceSaver` | `SpaceSaver.saver` | ⚠️ Experimental. Renders **black** inside the modern screensaver sandbox — see below. |

## Installation (quick start)

Turn `SpaceSaver.app` into a real screensaver (shows after N minutes idle across
every display, hides on any input). Run from the repo root:

```sh
# 1. Build the app (needs Xcode + Node)
xcodebuild -project macos/SpaceSaver.xcodeproj -scheme SpaceSaverApp \
  -configuration Release -derivedDataPath macos/build

# 2. Install it
cp -R macos/build/Build/Products/Release/SpaceSaver.app /Applications/

# 3. Install the idle-watcher LaunchAgent (starts at login, runs in the background)
cp macos/net.geraldhofbauer.spacesaver.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.geraldhofbauer.spacesaver.plist
```

The idle delay is the last argument in the plist (`--watch 300` = 5 minutes) —
edit it and re-`bootstrap` to change it. Uninstall the watcher with:

```sh
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/net.geraldhofbauer.spacesaver
```

**Heads-up — avoid overlap with the macOS screensaver.** The app is *not* the
system screensaver, so macOS's own screensaver (System Settings → Screen Saver)
will still trigger at its own idle time and draw on top. Either set the app's
`--watch` delay shorter than the system one (so you normally see SpaceSaver), or
set the macOS screensaver to **Never** so SpaceSaver is the only one. And don't
select the experimental `SpaceSaver.saver` there — it renders black (see below).

To just try it once without installing anything:

```sh
open /Applications/SpaceSaver.app     # or the built .app — shows now; any input quits
```

## Why the standalone app (and not just a `.saver`)

A `.saver` bundle is the "native" way to ship a screensaver, and it's built
here too. But on macOS 14+ (verified on **26.5**) the `legacyScreenSaver`
sandbox that hosts third-party savers has two blockers for a WebGL/WKWebView
saver, **both confirmed on real hardware**:

1. **WebGL renders black.** The page loads and the DOM/HUD draws, but the
   Three.js `<canvas>` stays black — the sandbox denies the WebKit GPU path.
   The *identical* code renders perfectly outside the sandbox.
2. **One process per display.** macOS spawns a separate `legacyScreenSaver`
   process for each screen, so a shared `WKProcessPool` / `BroadcastChannel`
   can't sync the displays — the seams would drift even if (1) were fixed.

`SpaceSaver.app` sidesteps both: it's a normal app, so **one process** owns a
borderless full-screen window on every display. WebGL renders, and because all
the web views share one process they sync over `BroadcastChannel` out of the
box — exactly the seamless, in-lockstep result the task calls for. The `.saver`
target is kept for the System-Settings integration and in case Apple relaxes
the sandbox; if you select it and see black, that's the sandbox, not a bug.

## Build

Requires Xcode 16+ and Node (for the web build). The build's *"Bundle standalone
web build"* phase runs `npm run build:standalone` in the repo root and copies
`dist/spacesaver.html` into the app bundle, so the web side is always the single
source of truth — no committed 600 kB artifact.

```sh
# from macos/
xcodebuild -project SpaceSaver.xcodeproj -scheme SpaceSaverApp -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build
# product: build/Build/Products/Release/SpaceSaver.app  (or DerivedData if you build in Xcode)
```

Or open `SpaceSaver.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build the **SpaceSaverApp** scheme.

## Run modes

```sh
open -n SpaceSaver.app                                 # play now: game across all displays, ⌘Q quits
SpaceSaver.app/Contents/MacOS/SpaceSaver --watch 300   # agent: show after 300 s idle, hide on input
```

- **Immediate (playable) mode** — launched with no arguments, it's a **game**:
  moving the mouse starts Coin Rush across every display (coins/asteroids sync
  from the primary "master" display; you can steer from any screen). Input flows
  to the game; only **⌘Q** quits.
- **`--watch <secs>` (screensaver) mode** — the agent the LaunchAgent in
  [Installation](#installation-quick-start) runs at login. Shows after N seconds
  idle, hides on **any** input. This is the "real screensaver" setup.

> Use **`open -n`** for the playable window: with the `--watch` LaunchAgent
> running, a plain `open SpaceSaver.app` just activates the already-running
> watcher instead of starting a game instance.

## Signing

The project is set to **ad-hoc** signing (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"`), so it
builds and runs locally with no Developer account. For an unsigned/ad-hoc build,
the first launch may need right-click → **Open** (or **System Settings →
Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**). To distribute, set your Team/identity in
the target's signing settings and notarize as usual — same flow as the other
`net.geraldhofbauer.*` apps.

## The `.saver` (optional)

```sh
xcodebuild -project SpaceSaver.xcodeproj -scheme SpaceSaver -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build
cp -R build/Build/Products/Release/SpaceSaver.saver ~/Library/Screen\ Savers/
```

Then pick it in **System Settings → Screen Saver**. Expect a black canvas with
only the HUD until the sandbox limitations above are lifted.

## Layout / notes

- `DisplayLayout.swift` — turns the `NSScreen` arrangement into each display's
  `?view` offset (with the y-flip: `NSScreen` is y-up, the web canvas y-down)
  and picks the primary display as sync `master`.
- `SaverWebView.swift` — the shared `WKWebView` factory (load path, mute,
  `localStorage` fallback). Used by both targets.
- Audio is forced muted, and Web Audio needs a user gesture the screensaver
  never gets — so it's silent by design. No network is used (the standalone
  build is fully inlined).
- Only the idle mode is relevant in a screensaver context (Coin Rush / Explore
  need pointer input, which dismisses it).
